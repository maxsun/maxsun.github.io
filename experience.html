    <h3>My Experience:</h3>

    <li>I've been learning programming for the past 5 years.
    I'm proficient in Python, Java, and Javascript.
    I'm mediocre in Go and C.</li>

    <li>I've written full-stack projects. My go-to framework is Flask on Heroku.</li>

    <li>I've been part of a FTC robotics team for the past 4 years. We are in the top 4% of teams and have traveled from St. Louis to Australia for tournaments.</li>

    <li>I've written an iOS app for San Diego Youth Services.</li>

    <li>I've also won a hackathon with an Android app for Live Well San Diego, the app was for helping compare your own health to that of your community.</li>

    <li>I've experimented with art made with code.</li>

    <li>I worked an internship at Maple Food, where I created a system for analyzing user reviews.</li>

    <li>I've used websockets to create programs for school.</li>

    <li>I've written many simple scripts to get better at programming. Ranging from webcrawlers to file transfer programs using websockets in C.</li>

    <li>Last year, I worked on an independent study at school for shortening text. It helped me learn NLP, and how to manage big data.</li>

    <h3>Awards (mostly meaningless, but a way of quantifying my work):</h3>

    <li>Winner of FTC San Diego Regional Championship (2015 & 2016)</li>

    <li>3rd Place of the San Diego Live Well Hackathon</li>

    <li>Winner of the FTC Motivate Award at the West Coast Super Regional tournament</li>

    <li>2nd Place of the Asia Pacific Invitational FTC tournament</li>

    <h3>Why I love computer science:</h3>
    I love computer science because of its ability to bend to whatever subjects I love. No matter the time, and no matter the subject, computer science applies. Because of this, my C.S. skills are applical to any of my constantly-changing interests. When I'm interested in English, I can learn about NLP and text generation. When I'm interested in art, I can use HTML canvas and Processing. When I'm interested in algorithms, I can learn about compilers and optimization strategies.
