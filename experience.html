    <b>I've applied my C.S. knowledge:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>At a summer 2015 internship at <a href="http://www.maple.com">Maple</a>, a New York City-based startup, where I worked directly with the CTO and made a tool for analyzing user reviews.</li>
        <li>In <a href="https://github.com/maxsun/MakeLessLong">an independent study</a> where I (with a friend) created a text-summarization bot.</li>
        <li>At <a href="https://Fusion-code.github.io">Fusion Code San Diego</a>, which I co-founded.</li>
        <li>In <a href="http://termalert.me">TermAlert</a>, a service that texts you when a terminal command is complete.</li>
        <li>In <a href="https://github.com/maxsun/rayCastJS">this</a> pure-javascript raycasting engine.</li>
        <li>As a programmer on my FTC Robotics team, which has placed among the top 4% of teams in the world. Our team has traveled to Oakland, St. Louis, and Sydney for international tournaments.</li>
        <li>... And in many more ways that I'd be happy to tell you about!</li>
    </div>
    <b>Over the last 5 years I've learned many languages:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Javscript</li>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>HTML + CSS</li>
        <li>Processing</li>
    </div>
    <b>I've learned the ins-and-outs of the full-stack. My prefered stack is:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>SQL Alchemy</li>
        <li>Flask</li>
        <li>JNinja + HTML + CSS + JQuery/Javascript</li>
        <li>Hosted on Heroku or Digital Ocean (I use Heroku for most of my needs because of its ability to deploy directly from GitHub)</li>
    </div>
    <b>Whilst learning the front-end of the full-stack, I've learned:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>How to make RESTful APIs.</li>
        <li>How to use many different web API services, such as Twilio and Stripe.</li>
        <li>How to use websockets (I prefer SocketIO + Flask-SocketIO because of their short setup time).</li>
        <li>Javascript libraries like: SocketIO, Ionic, React, Angular, and JQuery.</li>
        <li>Some fun stuff like Animate.css and HTML Canvas.</li>
    </div>
    <b>Whilst learning the back-end of the full-stack, I've learned:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>How to use SQL, more specifically: SQLite, MYSql, and SQLAlchemy.</li>
        <li>How to write unit tests and how to use them in TDD.</li>
        <li>Functional programming techniques.</li>
        <li>Agile programming techniques like "minimum viable product" and "paired programming".
        <li>Different types of web frameworks: Gorilla, Flask, and Django.</li>
        <li>Algorithms and optimization like sorts, searches, and Big-O Analysis (admittedly not my strongest suit).</li>
    </div>
    <b>Some of my favorite things I've learned are:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>HTML Canvas, CSS, and Processing; I find it really satisfying to make art with programming.</li>
        <li>Machine Learning, especially genetic algorithms. How can you not love seeing AI do stuff you thought only humans could do?</li>
        <li>Compilers. My most recent interest has been creating my own compilers for my own programming language ideas. Although most of my ideas don't work out in the long run, working with these compilers has helped me learn exactly what I like in a programming language.</li>
    </div>
    <b>Over the years, I've become familiar with:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>Lisps</li>
        <li>C and C#</li>
        <li>Docker and VMs</li>
        <li>AWS and Google App Engine</li>
    </div>
