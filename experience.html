    <b>Over my last 5 years of learning programming, I've learned many languages:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Javscript</li>
        <li>Go</li>
        <li>HTML + CSS</li>
        <li>Processing</li>
    </div>
    <b>I've learned the ins-and-outs of the full-stack. My prefered stack is:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>SQL Alechmy</li>
        <li>Flask</li>
        <li>JNinja + HTMl + CSS + JQuery/Javascript</li>
        <li>Hosted on Heroku or Digital Ocean</li>
    </div>
    <b>Whilst learning the front-end of the full-stack, I've learned:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>How to make RESTful APIs</li>
        <li>How to use many different web API services. Such as Twilio and Stripe.</li>
        <li>How to use websockets (I prefer SocketIO + Flask-SocketIO).</li>
        <li>Javascript libraries like: SocketIO, Ionic, React, Angular, and JQuery.</li>
        <li>Some fun stuff like Animate.css and HTML Canvas.</li>
    </div>
    <b>Whilst learning the back-end of the full-stack, I've learned:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>How to use SQL, more specifically: SQLite, MYSql, and SQLAlchemy.</li>
        <li>How to write unit tests.</li>
        <li>Functional programming techniques.</li>
        <li>Agile programming techniques like "minimum viable product" and "paired programming".
        <li>Different types of web frameworks: Gorilla, Flask, and Django.</li>
        <li>Algorithms and optimization like sorts, searches, and Big-O Analysis (admittedly not my strongest suit).</li>
    </div>
    <b>Some of my favorite things I've learned are:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>HTML Canvas, CSS, and Processing; I find it really satisfying to make art with programming.</li>
        <li>Machine Learning. Especially genetic algorithms. How can you not love seeing AI do stuff you thought I only humans could do?</li>
        <li>Compilers. My most recent interest has been messing around with my own compilers and my own programming language ideas. Messing around with these compilers has helped me learn exactly what I like in a programming language.</li>
    </div>
    <b>I've applied my C.S. knowledge:</b>
    <div class="listbox">
        <li>At an internship at <a href="http://www.maple.com">Maple</a>, where I made a tool for analyzing user reviews.</li>
        <li>In <a href="https://github.com/maxsun/MakeLessLong">an independent study</a> where I (with a friend) created a text-summarization bot.</li>
        <li>In an experimental programming language called min.</li>
        <li>At Fusion Code San Diego, which I co-founded.</li>
        <li>In this SMS bot.</li>
        <li>In <a href="https://github.com/maxsun/rayCastJS">this</a> pure-javascript raycasting engine.</li>
        <li>On my FTC Robotics team, which has placed among the top 4% of teams in the world. Our team's traveled to Oakland, St. Louis, and Sydney for international tournaments.
