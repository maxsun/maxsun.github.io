# Semantic Conceptions of Information

The general definition of a single piece of data, or "datum" is:

## The Diaphoric (read: differential) Definition of Data (DDD):
A datum is a commonly accepted fact regarding some difference or lack of uniformity within some context.

DDD can be considered on 3 levels:
1. *Diaphora de re* refers to a lack of uniformity in the real world.
2. *Diaphora de signo* refers to a lack of uniformity in perception.
3. *Diaphora de dicto* refers to a lack of uniformity between symbols.

Data is commonly classified into 5 categories, but they are not mutually exclusive nor rigid.
1. *Primary* data is a direct answer to a specific question; like an Engine light turned on.
2. *Secondary* data is the opposite of primary data; data provided by their absence. Like the fact that the Tire-pressure light is not on.
3. *Metadata* are indications about the nature of other data. Metadata describes properties like the language, encoding, etc.
4. *Operational* data concerns the dynamics of an information system. For example, the fact that the Engine light indicates an issue with the engine.
5. *Derivative* data is extracted from patterns of other data. For example, the patterns of Engine noises might indicate issues with the engine.



There are many valid interpretations of Information depending on the context.

## General Definition of Information (GDI)
$\theta$ is an instance of information (understood as semantic content) iff:
1. $\theta$ consists of one or more "data";
2. the data in $\theta$ is syntactically valid or "well formed";
3. the well-formed data in $\theta$ complys with the semantics of the chosen system.

Essentially, GDI suggests that information is well-formed, meaningful data.
GDI suggests a number of appealing characteristics of data and information:
- a datum is a relation entity because being a datum is an external property.
- information can consist of different types of data as relata.
- information cannot be dataless.
- information cannot exist without a data representation.
- data can have semantics independently of an informee.
